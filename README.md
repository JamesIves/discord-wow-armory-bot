[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JamesIves/discord-wow-armory-bot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JamesIves/discord-wow-armory-bot) [![Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/JamesIves/discord-wow-armory-bot.svg)](https://github.com/JamesIves/discord-wow-armory-bot/issues)

With this bot you're able to lookup a [World of Warcraft](http://worldofwarcraft.com/) character's item level, notable achievements, and pve/pvp progression with a command within [Discord](https://discordapp.com/). 

## Installation Steps :minidisc: 

1. Visit the [Blizzard API website](https://dev.battle.net/) and sign up for an API client id/secret.
2. Visit the [Discord API website and create an application](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/). You'll need to create a bot user and retrieve the [bot token](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro#bots-and-apps) it provides.
3. Invite the bot user to your server using the following URL by replacing the `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET` portion with the one found within your [Discord API settings](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/): `https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE&scope=bot&permissions=0`
4. Click the button below and enter the required fields to deploy the bot to [Heroku](http://heroku.com). If the required tokens were provided correctly the bot should appear online within Discord and begin responding to commands.

## FAQ :speech_balloon: 
Here's a list of frequently asked questions.
```
Q: Why does it show that my alt has completed an achievement?
A: Some achievements are account wide so the API response for your alt will be the same as your main.

Q: Do you plan on supporting Mythic+ scores?
A: Only if the official Blizzard API begins supporting their own metric.

Q: Why don't you show this raid?
A: I aim to support the most recent raids in the current expansion. Because Discord has a character limit I will start trimming the oldest raid in the current expansion if necessary.

Q: What expansion does this bot currently support?
A: Battle for Azeroth.
